This is the repository of the my Master's dissertation.
I am 'forced' to work on a number of different machines
and this will be the easiest way to ensure that my progress
doesn't get lost in the shuffling around.

UoYCSProkect.cls is the project template that is required for the
department. 

Dissertation.tex is the main tex file that will hold the report.
I will probably have each chapter in a separate tex file to make
it easier to print out chapters individually. 

All images will be placed in sub-directories (which are not yet created).

.gitignore is set to ignore the files that are created when pdflatex compiles a document. 

Feel free to look/comment but for a while it will not be
very interesting. 

Cheers
